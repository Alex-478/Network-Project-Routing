## **Overview**  
This project focuses on the planning and configuration of a fictional network as part of the **Data Routing** course in the Computer Engineering degree at the **Instituto Superior de Engenharia de Coimbra (ISEC)** during the 2022/2023 academic year. The objective is to develop skills in designing and configuring local and wide-area networks (LAN/WAN).  

## **Features**  

- Network topology design  
- Private and public addressing (VLSM)  
- Routing protocols: OSPF, EIGRP, RIP  
- Authentication mechanisms  
- Bandwidth management  
- Routing tables configuration  
- Primary and secondary exit strategies  

## **Project Structure**  
- **Introduction**: Overview of the network design  
- **Topology**: Visual representation of the network  
- **Addressing**: Detailed IP allocation, including private and public addressing  
- **Branches**: Individual configurations for different sections (Administration, Hotel, Restaurant, etc.)  
- **Routing Tables**: Configurations and protocol choices  
- **Conclusion**: Summary of results and learnings
